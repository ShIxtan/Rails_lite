#Rails Lite

Clone of Ruby on Rails, reimplementing many of he popular Rails tools.

- models(SQLObject) have associations and are lazy-loading
- router recognizes standard RESTful actions
- uses ERB for views
- controllers have access to a params hash, as well as sessions and flash cookies
- CSRF authentication
- bin/server.rb currently has a couple of simple controllers and routes.
